## Summary ##
I start loving writing code in middle school when I created my first web page using Notepad. It was so impressive that I look back on that feeling with warmth. When you understand that you made it on your own, and it works perfectly, it inspires even more. I continued to develop my professional skills at the university. At university, I studied deeply web technologies, algorithms, design patterns, databases and received general information on how to develop scalable, maintainable, and reliable software. I believe that people who develop software in some way make people's lives better and encourage them to acquire and learn new skills.

In general, I keen on new technologies and approaches to develop software. It motivates and pushes me forward. Recently, I interested in iOS development and I hope it will open a new professional page in my career.
